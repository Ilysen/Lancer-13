	name = "Access Corridor"
	description = "Access Corridor (abbreviation ACO, pronounced \"ackoh\") is small but growing transit/freight firm specializing in long-term hauling trips throughout the Diaspora. Founded in 4955u, and acquired by IPS-Northstar as an autonomous subsidiary in 4993u, the corpro recently marked its sixtieth year in operation.<br/><br/>\
	\
	Although ACO maintains a variety of operations, its specialty - and the niche in which it has met with the most success - is refining and transporting fuel and passengers to distant worlds and stations that are otherwise costly to incorporate into existing routes. ACO-operated ships trend towards long and meandering trips far off the beaten path, often spending months or years in realtime between stops in slapdash routes that never really end.<br/><br/>\
	\
	In the modern day, ACO has found itself in a period of rapid growth and expansion, partly due to having received significant investment from IPS-N in recent years."
